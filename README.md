# Python-Requirements-Generator
A script designed to generate a simple requirements.txt for any python script. The purpose of this project is generate a `requirement.txt` without having to use `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt` as it would give you all non-builtin modules that you have installed. This project's purpose is to make it short and sweet by only generating a file with a list of required modules needed. 

### Please NOTE: This project does not handle custom modules that you build on your own.

## Dependency
 * Python 3.8 or higher

## Future Plans 
- [] Handle multiple python files at once
- [] Handle custom modules.
